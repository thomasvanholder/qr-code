<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
  You have created a QR Menu for <strong><%= @restaurant.name %></strong>.
</p>
<p>
  To edit your QR Menu, just follow this link: <br>
   <%= @restaurant.name %>: <a href="<%= edit_restaurant_url(@restaurant) %>">Edit QR Code Menu</a>.
</p>




<p>Here is your QR Code. It stays the same whatever changes you might later do.</p>

<%= @svg.html_safe %>

<p>Thanks for joining and have a great day!</p>
